// PasteMsg is a batched paste delivered by bracketed-paste mode. Layers
// that want paste to behave differently from typed input (e.g. suppress
// autocomplete, single-undo-snapshot the whole block) should consume
// this. Layers that don't handle it get the usual per-byte key events
// only if the terminal isn't in bracketed-paste mode -- with
// pasteOn active, the bytes between CSI 200~ and CSI 201~ are captured
// and delivered as one PasteMsg with no Key events in between.
